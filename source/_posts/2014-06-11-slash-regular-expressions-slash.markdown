####Quote of the day:####
> "Some people, when confronted with a problem, think 'I know, I'll use regular expressions.'
Now they have two problems. " - [**Jamie Zawinski**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Zawinski "Jamie Zawinski's Wikipedia Page")



####What are they?####
> A regular expression provides a concise and flexible means to "match" (specify and recognize) strings of text, such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters. Common abbreviations for "regular expression" include regex and regexp.
- From [**Codecademy**](http://www.codecademy.com/fr/courses/javascript-intermediate-en-NJ7Lr/0/1 "Codecademy Website")

In other words, regular expressions are pattern finders. An easy one looks like that..


They can be daunting at first... but in reality can be read and writtten easily if you give them some time and attention.


####Exercice:####
In a recent lab, [**Regex_rally-ruby-005**](https://github.com/flatiron-school-students/regex_rally-ruby-005 "Flatiron's Github Repo") we were asked to write a regular expression that only matches valid email addresses. 

my_regex = _ 

Through a list of e-mails the *spec* wanted our regular expression to match _or_** not match, implicit directions on how to construct our regex are being given: 

```ruby
match = %w{steven@flatironschool.com john.doe@example.com phil@example.co.uk }
do_not_match = ["steven@flatironschool", "user at example.com", "user@example.com@example.com"]
```


1. The first important step is to write the opening and closing forward slashes of our regualar expressions (LE DUH.) as follows :
